# R-notes
The repo has a collection of R Markdown files (*.Rmd). These are notes I made while programming in R. The notes help me to refresh quickly useful functions and approaches regarding the algorithm implementation in R.

* [r-notes.Rmd](https://github.com/Gennady-Khvorykh/R-notes/blob/master/r-notes.Rmd) has a list of basic functions.
* [feature-selection-notes.Rmd](https://github.com/Gennady-Khvorykh/R-notes/blob/master/feature-selection-notes.Rmd) lists approaches to feature engineering under Machine Learning
